# What is JOS?
JOS is a high-quality and sustainable dataset that contains judicial opinion summaries of the US Supreme Court we scraped from FindLaw's public repository, and merged with docket entry meta-data we extracted from SCDB.

The main goal of the dataset is to aid the study of automatic issue-area discovery in opinion summaries, using transformer-based language models pretrained on either a generalized or a legal domain. 

The data is formatted as a collection of json objects.
